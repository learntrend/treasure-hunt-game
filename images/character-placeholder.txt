Recommended:
- File name: master-archibald.png (or .jpg)
- Size: 400x400px minimum (square, circular crop recommended)
- Format: PNG with transparency or JPG

The image should be a portrait of a steampunk character (man with top hat, goggles, etc.) as described.

- Line ~245: character-image src
- Line ~255: character-popup-image src
